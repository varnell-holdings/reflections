When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

 - backup
 - sharing with others
 - working from multiple sites/computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

 - the remote is presumable shared and thus you want to see what aothers are doing before puting their work in your repository

 Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
