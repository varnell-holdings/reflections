In early lesson two I have learnt 2 commands 'git init' and 'git status'.
git init turns a directory into a repository.
git status ??
A git init does not do an initial commit. It installs a hidden .git file in the directory which contains metadata used to track changes.
list of git commands I have learnt
 - clone			pull a resitory from a url
 - log			see what  recent commits have been made
 - diff			see the differences between two commits
 - checkout		change a file (and its associated fiLES) back  a previou
 - init			make a local dir into a repository .git file inserted
 - status		show what is going on in staging area
 - add			add file to staging area
 - reset		remove file from staging area
 - commit       move file from staging area to repository
